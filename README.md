# Contact Form – CS 81 Module 11

This is my React contact form project for Module 11 Assignment 11A.  
It includes controlled inputs for name, email, and message, and uses `useState` to manage the form data.

When the form is submitted, it checks that all fields are filled out and that the email includes an `@`. If everything looks good, it shows the submitted data using `JSON.stringify()` and clears the form.

## What’s Inside
- `ContactForm.js`: Handles the form logic, validation, and rendering
- `App.js`: Imports and displays the form
- `README.md`: This file!

## How to Run It
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
